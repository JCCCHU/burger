# Node Express Handlebars Assignment - Burger Devourer

This app will allow users to log and eat burgers.

By typing the names of burgers in the form they can create new burgers to 'eat' (click) in a column on the left. Burgers that are eaten are transferred to a column on the right.

The app is deployed on Heroku and uses MySQL functionality, which takes it a step up from your standard burger-eating app coded purely in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The app in its current state is missing various functionality, such as the ability to click burgers, name burgers, or see burgers. When trying to load burger.all from "/" it doesn't detect orm.all is a function.
